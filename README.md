### Built with

- Angular
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Typescript
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I decided to go for this project mainly as Angular practice. It helped me solidify what I already knew but I also learned a lot of stuff.

I learned how to dynamically handle different views to conditionally display entire sections like mobile menu, lightbox gallery or overlay.

I learned how to close modals by clicking outside the modal in Angular (invisible overlay)

I learned how to dynamically handle slider fully created in proper Angular without any JS code, which wasn't nearly as hard as I thought it might be.

### Continued development

I will keep focusing on Angular, practicing it, but also slowly incorporating more complex functionalities as well as learning ciompletely new concepts
